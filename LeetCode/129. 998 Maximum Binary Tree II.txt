Understanding this problem was little difficult but the exams sometimes helps a lot in such cases. To solve this problem recursively there were only two cases and both were explained well in the given examples.

// Solution Code
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* insertIntoMaxTree(TreeNode* root, int val) {
        if (root && root->val > val) {
            root->right = insertIntoMaxTree(root->right, val);
            return root;
        }
        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(val);
        node->left = root;
        return node;  
    }
};
