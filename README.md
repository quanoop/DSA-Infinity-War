## _<All the solved DSA Problems by me>_
The sole purpose of this repo. is to collect all the problems with their solution which are solved by me in my journey of learning DSA.
The code i am uploading here is written in .txt files. Problems uploaded here are from different plateforms and coureses I have taken. Some of them are mentioned below.

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [GeekforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- Some Udemy and Youtube Courses
## Language Used

- I have used C++ as the dominant language in most of the problems.
- Other possible languages of code are Python, Javascript and Java, but the chances are rare.
- C++ is one of the most popular language for DSA ans CP.
- It is a very fast language in execution and library is huge which is of great help.


## In the code file.

Every Code file uploaded here has the following sections:

- Question
- Comments
- First Instinct
- Solution
- Optimised Solution
- Some important note etc.

Additional sections other than question and answer are inserted to make a better understanding of the problem. This also helps in remmembring tips and trickes used for solving a specific problem.

## Final Note 
```sh
Feel free to contribute and give your suggestions.
Just remmeber naming of solved problems is in specific manner. So try to follow that if you are working on this repo.
Share and Spread Love.
